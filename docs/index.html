        Welcome to the <b>GPS BOY</b> home page. Yet another GB hardware project...
        <br><br>
        (Last update: 14/10/2004)

<b>GPS BOY</b> is a portable GPS (<b>G</b>lobal <b>P</b>ositioning <b>S</b>ystem)
receiver system based on a GPS integrable module
<a href="http://www.trimble.com/lassenskii.html">(Trimble's Lassen SK II)</a>
and a Game Boy Color. As I guess you already know,  GPS is a system
for obtaining the exact position coordinates (and other data) of a receiver
placed anywhere on Earth. The receiver uses an antenna to track the signals
sent by a group of satellites known as the <b>GPS constellation</b>, and
uses the received data to calculate longitude, latitude, speed, etc.
<p>
I know, adding GPS capabilities to a GBC is not a new idea. Actually there is
a previous project by <a href="http://teamknox.tripod.com">TeamKNOx</a>
called <b>GB GPS</b> which already did. However, since I developed this
for fun, I decided to release it for the sake of the GB development "scene".
<p>
To run this you will need:
<p>
<li>A Game Boy Color (it won't work with GB Pocket nor GB Advance).
<li>A <a href="http://www.trimble.com/lassenskii.html">Lassen SK II</a>
(GPS receptor board).
<li>A serial cable to connect both devices. See the package's documentation for
further info.

Basically, the GBC and GPS receiver board are connected through a
serial cable. The provided software (ROM image file) must then be loaded into
the GBC using your favourite flash card (Bung, etc.), and both devices
turned on. When the system is operating, the GBC communicates with the
GPS board using a serial protocol called TAIP to configure, obtain
GPS data, etc. Position values, time, status, etc. are shown on the
color LCD screen, as you can see in the sample pictures. It also
includes an experimental map function.

      <p><b>Gerd Bartelt</b> has reported that <b>GPS BOY</b> will also work fine
        using a different GPS module: the <a href="http://www.trimble.com/lassensq.html">
        Lassen SQ</a>. This is a more compact
        module than the Lassen SK II, and it is compatible with it at serial communication
        level (same protocols, voltage, etc.), so you can use it instead. You won't
        need to change a single bit of the software, only the physical connection to
        the GPS module and the power supply (3V instead of 5V) need to be adapted.</p>
      <p>See how compact it can be with this new <b>Lassen SQ</b> module, including
        an embedded type antenna.<br>
        <br>
        Thanks a lot for the picture, Gerd!</p></td>

GPS BOY is provided for free, including source code. It is intended
for educational purposes, so you shouldn't use it commercially
(at least not without my permission). Also I won't
accept any responsabilities on the possible damage you may cause using
this thing.
<p>
If you are seriously interested, I encourage you to download the package
and read all the documentation. Though brief, all you need to know about
connections, instructions of use, etc. is there.
